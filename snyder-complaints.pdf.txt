AFFIDAVIT OF PROBABLE CAUSE
On December 7, 2015, members of the Reading Police Department were dispatched to 626 s. 17 У2
street, Reading, Pennsylvania, Berks County, for an unresponsive three month old male. When officers
arrived they found members of the City of Reading Fire/Ambulance Department on location with the
unresponsive male in an ambulance. Officers were told that the male, who was later identified as Anthony
DiNOZZO Snyder D.O.B. 08/25/15, had expired. At approximately 2127 hours, Deputy Coroners John
Hollenbach and Melissa Sealie pronounced Anthony dead.
When this Investigator arrived on scene, I was directed inside of the home and found Patricia Snyder,
mother of Anthony DiNOZZO Snyder. After gathenng some basic information I asked Patricia if she could
provide any details about when she last saw Anthony alive. Patncia stated that shortly after 4 p.m., her
husband, Charles Snyder, left for work and that Anthony was placed in his bouncer. Patncia indicated that
around 5 p.m. she changed Anthony's diaper, fed and burped him, and then placed him into his bassinet.
At 6:30 p.m. Anthony began to cry so she picked him up and held him until he fell back asleep. Patncia
placed Anthony into his bassinet. Patricia stated that around 7 p.m. she went downstairs to prepare food
for her two other minor children, who were ages one and six. Patncia related that after she fed her six year
old son, she began feeding her one year old son. While feeding her one year old son, her six year old, who
went back upstairs, began screaming. Patricia ran upstairs and found Anthony in his bassinet and
unresponsive. Pathcia stated that she removed Anthony from his bassinet and placed Anthony on her bed
and began performing CPR. Patricia called emergency from a touch pad alarm system installed in the
home. When asked about any medical problems Anthony may have had, Patncia indicated that Anthony
had been sick but nothing out of the ordinary.
While this Investigator was still at the home, Charles Snyder, Anthony's father, arrived. I explained to
Charles Snyder why I was at the home and advised him that Anthony had expired pnor to his arnval. I
began to ask Charles about the last time he saw Anthony alive. Charles advised that he left for work at
approximately 4 p.m. and that Anthony was in his bouncer when he left. Charles stated that Anthony had
been sick the month before and had been placed on antibiotics. Charles also related that Anthony had
been sick with cold like symptoms. Charles related that he gave Anthony an over-the-counter cold
medication that he purchased at Turkey Hill.
Patncia Snyder and Charles Snyder are the only adults living at 626 s. 17/2 street and are the sole care
providers for Anthony.
This Investigator did observe multiple baby bottles filled with formula in the kitchen refrigerator.
Additionally, there were cans of unused powdered formula in the kitchen.
On 12/08/15 an autopsy was performed by Dr. Supriya Kuruvilla, the Chief of Pathology at Reading Health
System. Dr. Kuruvilla noted that Anthony's fat reserves were near-total depletion, he had a depressed
anterior fontanelle, and his face was gaunt with sunken eyes and cheeks. His limbs were thin with

pronounced bony prominences. Dr. Kuruvilla also noted that Anthony had a contusion on his right cheek
and another contusion on the back of his ear. As part of the autopsy, postmortem toxicology
performed. The toxicology results showed that Anthony had 52 mcg/mL Acetaminophen (Tylenol),
770ng/mL Doxylamine (Unisom), and 1000 ng/mL Dextro/Levomethorphan in his system. Doxylamine is
an over the counter antihistamine found in cold remedies.
was
On 02/26/16 a final Certificate of Death was completed and the manner of death was ruled a homicide
The cause
of death was from Acute Doxylamine Toxicity and Chronic Nutritional Neglect (starvation).
The results of the autopsy and other reports, including Anthony's medical records, were forwarded to Dr.
Lon Frasier, Professor of Pediatncs and Director of the Center for the Protection of Children at the Penn '
state Children's Hospital. After reviewing the documents. Dr. Frasier gave an opinion to a reasonable
degree of medical certainty that Anthony was severely malnourished and died as a result of medical
neglect and the administration of dangerous over the counter medications.
Anthony's medical records shows he was seen by Dr. Joseph stangarity, his pnmary care physician, on
November 12,2015 for an upper respiratory infection and was placed on amoxicillin. At that time Anthony
weighed 6.8 Ibs. Anthony's medical records note that Patricia Snyder was provided information stating
that over-the-counter cold medicine should never be given to an infant as it could have serious side effects.
Dr. Frasier also found evidence of physical abuse. Specifically, she noted that bruised found at autopsy
on Anthony's cheek and ear were significant in a child of Anthony's age as he would have been unable to
self-inflict such injuries.
Dr. Frasier noted that between Anthony's November 12, 2015 appointment and his autopsy, Anthony lost
25% of his body weight. She noted that Anthony would not have eaten well between November 12, 2015
and December 7, 2015 and this would have been apparent to a reasonable caregiver. The failure to seek
medical care for an infant who was clearly ill and not eating is medical neglect. Dr. Frasier opinion to a
reasonable degree of medical certainty Is that the medical neglect and the provision of dangerous over the
counter medication despite instructions to the contrary resulted in the overdose and death of Anthony
Snyder.
Based on information received from persons showing a truthful demeanor and all other evidence received
your affiant is requesting a warrant for the arrest of Patricia Ann Snyder, D.O.B. 11/03/1989, for the
aforementioned charges.
