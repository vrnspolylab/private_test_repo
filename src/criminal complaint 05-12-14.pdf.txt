Personal Contact (Observation of dnver, statements, pre-exit, sobriety tests, observation of the exit, odors, generai observations
such as speech, attitude, clothing, etc.)
I contacted the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle on the passenger side of the vehicle. I knocked on the
passenger window signaling the driver to roll down the window. I heard the driver say “Hello?” and observed
the driver look out the driver’s window. I again knocked on the window, the driver jumped a little bit and stated
“Oh you’re over there”. The driver then rolled the window down approximately % of the way. I identified myself
and explained the reason for the stop. The driver stated “Yeah I know I was going to go get new taillights
tomorrow”. I asked the driver for her license, registration, and insurance. While the driver was looking for the
documents I asked the driver where she was going, the driver stated to the hospital. I asked the driver if she
was OK, the driver stated that she was just going to pick up her daughter there. I asked if her daughter was
OK, the driver stated that she was dropped off there by someone and she just needed to be picked up. The
driver handed me the registration for the vehicle then began frantically patting pockets on her jacket in an
attempt to find her license. The driver would begin to pull something out of her pocket then shove it back into
her pocket. The driver stated “where is my wallet, what did I do with my license. I think I must have left it at
home”. The driver continued to look around the vehicle for her license. As the driver was trying to find her
license I observed her to have rapid clumsy movement. The driver’s speech was also fast and broken.
After approximately two minutes of searching for her license, the driver stated that she must not have her
license with her. I looked at the name on the registration (Elizabeth J. Cornell) and asked the driver if her name
was Elizabeth, the driver stated “Yeah”. I asked the driver what her date of birth was, the driver stated “Uhh,
uhh, umm, Гт not Elizabeth”. I asked the driver what her name was, the driver stated “Here is my ID I do not
have a license”. The driver handed me a Washington state Identification Only card identifying her as Vikki J.
Kropp DOB 12-19-1972.1 asked Kropp if she had any alcohol to drink, Kropp stated she did not have anything
to drink. I asked Kropp if she had smoked any marijuana, Kropp stated she had not smoked. I asked Kropp if
she had taken any medications in the past 24 hours, Kropp stated no. Kropp stated “I can have my mom come
get the vehicle she has a license, please I can’t afford another ticket”. I observed Kropp to be shaking more
than normal while talking with her.
I returned to my vehicle and performed a driver’s check on Kropp. The driver’s return stated that Kropp was ID
only suspended in the 3 '' degree for unpaid tickets. I re-contacted Kropp on the passenger side of the vehicle
and asked if she would step out of the vehicle and talk with me. Kropp asked “Are you going to make me do
those tests”. I asked Kropp if she would just step out and talk with me for a second. Kropp exited the vehicle
and had to use the vehicle for support as she walked towards the front of the vehicle.
Once in front of the vehicle I asked Kropp if she was OK, because I noticed she was shaking pretty bad. Kropp
stated she was fine. I told Kropp that we had the fact that she did not have a license out of the way and asked
if there was any other reason she seemed so antsy, Kropp stated she didn’t know. I asked Kropp when the last
time she smoked marijuana was, Kropp stated “about a month ago”. I asked Kropp when the last time she
used methamphetamines was, Kropp stated “Uh rve been clean for six months”. I asked Kropp when the last
time she used heroin was, Kropp stated “I haven’t”.
I asked Kropp if she would perform some voluntary field sobriety tests, Kropp stated Гт not very good at them
and I have these on”. Kropp pointed towards her boots that had approximately two inch heels. I advised Kropp
that we could work around them.
Pre-Arrest Screeninq (Field Sobneby Tests, Preliminary Breath Test)
The area the FSTS took placed was paved and had a slight grade. There was street lighting in the area and
Kropp’s back was positioned to both our vehicles. I asked Kropp if she had anything that might prevent her

Officer’s Name: K. DAHL
Badge No.: 524
I asked Kropp if she wouid like to do the Romberg balance test again, Kropp stated she did. I again explained
he test to Kropp and emphasized that she needed to tilt her head forward and tell me to stop when she
reached 30 seconds. When reminding Kropp to tilt her head forward and say stop, Kropp stated “Oh gotcha
yeah, OK, OK, yeah got it”.
I told Kropp to begin and at 16 seconds without tilting her head fonA/ard or opening her eyes Kropp stated
“Umm ok now”. I asked Kropp how long she thought that was, Kropp stated “30 seconds maybe a little longer
because I counted slower that time”. I asked Kropp how she counted. Kropp stated “1,2,3”. I asked Kropp if
she would be surprised if I told her that was only 16 seconds. Kropp stated “Yes that was 30 seconds I know I
counted, how do you count”. I told Kropp that I used a stop watch. Kropp stated ‘Td like to see you do this test
then how would you count”.
Arrest (Handcuffing, Searching, Constitutional Rights)
At approximately 0250 hours I considered all the above information, believed Kropp could not safely operate a
motor vehicle and placed Kropp under arrest for DUI and driving while license suspended. I placed Kropp into
handcuffs, checked the spacing, and double locked the handcuffs. I escorted Kropp to the rear of my patrol
vehicle where I read Kropp her Constitutional Rights directly from my departmental issued Miranda card,
searched her and placed her in the rear of my patrol vehicle. While Kropp was in the back seat I read Kropp
the voluntary blood draw consent form and asked Kropp if she would consent to a voluntary blood draw. Kropp
stated she would.
Silverdale Towing arrived on scene and impounded the vehicle according to Washington state law. At
approximately 0335 hours I cleared the scene and transported Kropp to Harrison Hospital where we arrived
approximately a minute later.
Administrative Process (ВАС and Disposition)
I escorted Kropp inside the hospital and into the waiting room, where I again went through the voluntary blood
draw consent form with Kropp. I asked Kropp if she would now submit to a voluntary blood draw, Kropp stated
“Yes” and signed thé consent form.
I escorted Kropp to the Laboratory where the blood draw took place. At approximately 0345 hours I observed
the phlebotomist clean Kropp’s right elbow with lodine and draw two vials of blood into the two grey topped
vials with a white powdery substance inside and an expiration date of 03-2015 that I provided.
At approximately 0359 hours we cleared the hospital and I transported Kropp to the Kitsap County Jail where
she was booked for DUI at approximately 0421 hours.
