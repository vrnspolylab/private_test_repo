WASHINGTON
FviTROL
REPORT OF INVESTIGATION
Primary Officer’s Narrative
Citation #
Cl 061278
Officer's Name: Trooper J. O'Connor
Badge No.: 950
On 6-8-2016 at approximately 0607 hours, while on routine patrol in Kitsap County wearing my full uniform
driving my fully marked patrol car, I was sitting on the shoulder of the westbound state Route 16 on ramp from
Burley Olalla conducting speed patrol with my PRO Laser III L#1365. The PRO Laser III was checked in prior
to beginning my shift and was found to be in proper working order.
At approximately 0607 hours, I observed a small red in color passenger car that had two small square shaped
tail lights illuminated, driving in lane two of two visually traveling at a higher rate than other motorists and
obtained a reading of 82 MPH in the posted 60 MPH zone on my PRO Laser III. I merged onto W.SR 16 and
attempted to catch up to the vehicle and conduct a traffic stop. Due to other motorists on the highway it took a
few miles to catch up to the vehicle. At the ivlullinex overpass I activated my emergency lights to stop the
vehicle.
At mile post 23,1 observed the red passenger car Washington plate #AKB3144 come to an abrupt stop on the
right shoulder. Due to other morning traffic in lane one of two, I was unable to stop behind the vehicle. Due to
the vehicle coming to an abrupt stop, I changed lanes from lane two of two to the right shoulder in front of the
vehicle.
I contacted the later identified driver, from his Washington state ID Card as FREDENBURG, RYAN ANDREW
DOB of 12-18-1993 and advised him of the reason for the stop. I also asked FREDENBURG if he had a
drivers' license not just an ID Card; FREDENBURG stated: “No.” After taking a few moments In gathering all of
FREDENBURG's Information, I returned to my patrol car and conducted a drivers’ check through WSP
Communications. Communications advised that FREDENBURG was DWLS/REVOKED in the 2'''  Degree with
priors. WSP Communications also advised that FREDENBURG had a FIR from 2013 and was arrested for DUI
and upon the search, the Officer found a pill bottle of Oxycodone.
FREDENBURG was later taken into custody for operating a motor vehicle while DWLS/REVOKED 2'''' Degree.
Upon searching FREDENBURG in his front left jeans pocket, I obtained a brown in color pill bottle with no
markings. The white prescription label was badly worn and completely unreadable. The bottle was later found
to have seven blue circular shaped pills inside.
I later asked FREDENBURG what the bottle contained; FREDENBURG stated: “Adderall.” I asked
FREDENBURG if he had a prescription for the Adderall; He stated he did. After the vehicle was released to a
licensed driver, I transported FREDENBURG to the Kitsap County Jail. FREDENBURG was booked on
DWLS/REVOKED 2''° Degree.
At the jail, FREDENBURG was advised that all prescnptions must be contained in a fully marked prescnption
bottle with the label. I also explained his citation for DWLS/REVOKED 2' ° Degree and his speed infraction.
I respectfully request FREDENBURG, RYAN ANDREW DOB of 12-18-1993 to also be charged with the
following.
•	69.50.4013, Possession of Controlled Substance.
/ certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury under the lav\rs of the state of Washington
	that this report is true and correct (RCW 9A. 72.085):
