Subject: Unrooting phones
Message Body:
I recently rooted my HTC Incredible and found a whole slew of new apps and functionality that I really like. I also found out that my work email frontend program (good for enterprise) checks for rooting and locks up if it detects that your phone is rooted.
Now I know I can unroot my phone without going back to factory settings, but I want to know a few things before I jump back:
1: will superuser permissions granted while rooted continue to be in effect after the de-rooting (ie does it permanently give permission by changing the rom or making the program privileged)?
2: If I changed to a ROM that offers the additional functionality that I am looking for (Cyanodroid for instance) and then unroot will those additional functions continue to work?
3: Is there any way to stop programs from being able to check rooting in the first place?
I think these would be good topics to address in your FAQ, and would really appreciate if you could shed any light on the subject.
Thanks,
Dave
