Notes/Narrative
i:r /t
On 05-26-2018 while traveling on Hwy 16 w. in my marked patrol vehicle 1 spotted a vehicle adjacent to me, license
91371CV, slam on its breaks causing the tires to skid and the vehicles front end to dip. There were no other vehicles in
front of this vehicle stopping like that was suspicious.
1 activated my emergency lights and stopped the vehicle just south of the Mullenix RD SE exit. The driver of the
vehicle, Ricky Demello, advised he did not have a driver's license out of Washington and had a suspended Hawaii
driver's license. Ricky also informed me he just bought this vehicle so there was no insurance on the vehicle. Ricky
was able to provide a Hawaii state ID card. Ricky said didn't intentionally stop the vehicle but knocked it into the
wrong gear by mistake. Ricky did not appear intoxicated as his eyes were of a normal color and his speech was not
slurred.
1 ran Ricky's name through CENCOM and was advised that his license from Hawaii was suspended but also that he
could not operate a motor vehicle without an ignition interlock device. 1 went back to speak with Ricky and confirmed
that he did not have an interlock device in the vehicle. Ricky explained to me that he just bought the vehicle thirty
minutes ago so the vehicle was not outfitted with an interlock device. Ricky also said he knew he should have had his
girlfriend drive the vehicle but decided to do it himself
1 cited Ricky for driving while license suspended in the third degree and for not having insurance. 1 advised Ricky 1
would be writing a criminal report for him driving without an interlock device and to expect a court date in the mail. A
tow truck was called for the vehicle because Ricky could not legally drive it and he said he did not feel safe driving the
vehicle since it appeared to be overheating. 1 stood by until Bethal Tow arrived and hooked up the vehicle.
Forward to Prosecutor.
