AFFIDAVIT OF PROBABLE CAUSE
Introduction
I.
Andrea Constand (hereinafter “the vietim”) was employed as the Direetor of
Operations for Temple University’s women's basketball team between Deeember
2001 and Mareh 31, 2004 and, in that eapaeity, was introdueed to Bill Cosby.
In the months following their introduetion, Cosby contaeted the vietim’s Temple
University offiee to diseuss business-related matters. Eventually, the vietim
and Cosby exehanged personal phone numbers and developed what the vietim
believed to be a sineere fnendship. Further, she eonsidered Cosby, thirty-seven
years her senior, to be a mentor, and deseribed instanees in whieh he invited her
to his home for dinner, invited her to restaurants, invited her to events,
introduced her to various people, and provided her with guidance and career
advice.
The victim told investigators she had no interest whatsoever in a romantic
relationship with Cosby, but described two separate incidents in which Cosby
made sexual advances towards her. The first incident occurred several months
after their initial meeting, when Cosby invited the victim to his home for dinner
prepared by his private chef. When she arrived, she sat and spoke with Cosby
near a fire. After about twenty minutes, the chef served her dinner, which she
ate by herself, and she drank some red wine. After dinner, she and Cosby were
sitting on the sofa when, without warning, Cosby reached over and touched her
pants, her waist, and her inner thigh. With that, she dismissed herself to go to
the bathroom and gathered her things to leave. Before her departure, Cosby
gave her a hottle of perfume and thanked her for little gifts she had hrought him.
The vietim ’was emharrassed by this encounter. She never thought he would hit
on her, espeeially sinee Cosby is mueh older than her father.
In the other ineident, the vietim went for a social visit to Coshy’s
Cheltenham home. She had consumed a couple glasses of wine and was talking
to him when “out of the blue” Coshy unhuttoned her pants and hegan touching
her. The victim leaned forward to stop him, at which point Coshy got up and
went into his kitchen. The victim left ten minutes later with neither of them
saying a word ahout what had just happened.
Despite these advances hy Coshy, the victim trusted him and continued to
For example, the
accept his invitations to social and professional functions,
victim attended a dinner at his home with a group of his friends and persons
working in the Philadelphia restaurant community. She also attended a dinner
at his Cheltenham home for a meeting with “academic people,” including the
President of Swarthmore College and professors from the University of
Pennsylvania. She went to Coshy’s New York City home to meet with one of
Coshy’s influential entertainment industry contacts. The victim also told police
that she met Coshy two other times, alheit hriefly, at his home and once at a
casino in Connecticut. She reported that nothing inappropriate occurred
during these events, all of which occurred hefore mid-Fehruary 2004.
2
Aggravated Indecent Assault at Cosby’s Cheltenham Home
On January 22, 2005, in a written statement, the vietim told police that
sometime between mid-January and mid-February of 2004, Cosby ealled her on
her personal cell phone and invited her to his home at 8210 New Second Street,
Cheltenham, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. During the call, Cosby told
her they were going to talk about the victim’s future career plans. Cosby added
that no one else would be present and that she should dress in comfortable
II.
clothing.
The victim arrived at the residence at about 8:45 PM. Cosby, dressed in a
sweat suit, greeted her at the front door and let her in. Once inside, the two sat
at a table near the front door and spoke about her future career plans. The
victim told Cosby she felt “drained,” and “emotionally occupied,” and that she
had been missing sleep. During the conversation, Cosby told her that he
wanted her to relax.
Within the next ten to fifteen minutes, Cosby went upstairs and the victim
went to the bathroom. The victim told police that when Cosby returned from
upstairs, he had three blue pills in his hand. Cosby urged her to take the pills,
saying to her, “[tjhese will make you feel good. The blue things will take the edge
off." The victim asked if the pills were herbal and Cosby replied, "Yes. Down
them. Put 'em down. Put them in your mouth," as he motioned for her to put
the three blue pills into her mouth. Cosby plaeed the pills in the victim’s hand
and directed her to “take the water.” She told Cosby she trusted him and then
used the water to swallow the pills.
3
Cosby then told the vietim to “taste the wine.” When she resisted, and told
him that she hadn’t eaten anything that day, Cosby again direeted her to “just
taste the wine.” In response, the vietim took a eouple sips of wine. The vietim
told investigators that after she ingested the pills, she and Cosby eontinued to
talk at the table. However, within about twenty to thirty minutes of ingesting
the pills, water, and wine, she began experieneing blurred vision and difrieulty
speaking. When she told Cosby how she was feeling, he instrueted her to lie
down and he assisted her to the eoueh. Cosby told her that he was “going to let
[her] relax.”
The vietim deseribed to the poliee the wide range of physieal symptoms she
experieneed during this time. She said that she lost all strength in her legs,
whieh felt "rubbery" and “like jelly.” She eould not see clearly beeause
everything had beeome “blurry” and “dizzy.” She felt “nauseous.” She eould
not keep her eyes open, was not aware of any sounds, had no sense of time, and
was “in and out.”
Cosby did not sit on the sofa with her, but instead positioned himself
behind her. Despite her impaired physieal and mental eondition, the vietim
was aware that Cosby was fondling her breasts, put his hands into her pants,
and penetrated her vagina with his fingers. Cosby also took the vietim’s right
hand and plaeed it onto his ereet penis. The vietim told investigators that she
did not eonsent to any of these aets, and was unable to move or speak during the
assault. She deseribed her eondition as “frozen” and “paralyzed.”
The vietim awoke in the Cosby home at about 4:00 AM the next morning.
4
She discovered that her sweater was bunehed up, and that her bra was undone
and had been moved above her breasts. She said that when she got up and
walked towards the door she saw Cosby, dressed in a robe, standing at the
bottom of the stairease. Cosby gave her a muffin, walked to the front door,
opened it, and said, "Alright." The vietim told investigators she left the
residenee without saying anything.
III. Victim’s Return to Canada and Disclosure
Within three months of the assault, in Mareh of 2004, the victim left the
Philadelphia area and returned to her parents’ home in Canada. Thereafter, the
vietim’s mother, Gianna Constand, noticed changes in her daughter. She said
there was a change in her daughter’s personality and that she had isolated
herself from her friends. Mrs. Constand also told investigators that her
daughter had sleep disturbances that included nightmares and instances in
whieh she would seream in her sleep. Mrs. Constand attempted to find out
from her daughter what was wrong with her but the victim simply did not
answer.
Eventually, on the morning of Thursday, January 13, 2005, the victim told
her mother that Cosby had sexually assaulted her. Shocked and devastated
upon hearing details of the sexual assault of her daughter, Mrs. Constand called
Cosby on the telephone to confront him. Mrs. Constand, who had spoken to
Cosby on the telephone multiple times in the past, failed to reach him on this
occasion and instead left a voicemail message. The Constands reported the
5
incident to the Durham Regional Poliee Serviee in Ontario, Canada.
IV. Mrs. Constand’s Conversations with Cosby
On January 16, 2005, Cosby returned Mrs. Constand’s eall. During the
two-and-a-half-hour eonversation that ensued, she pointedly asked Cosby what
he had done to her daughter and what he had given to her. In response to the
latter question, he told her that he would “have to look at the preseription bottle.”
He told Mrs. Constand that he eould not read the label beeause of an eye
eondition, but that he would write down the name of the medieation on a pieee of
paper and mail it to her.
Although Cosby did not identify the drug he gave to the vietim, during the
same eonversation he admitted fondling the victim’s breasts, digitally
penetrating her vagina, and placing the victim’s hand on his penis for sexual
gratification. Through these admissions to Mrs. Constand, Cosby directly
corroborated the victim’s report concerning these actions. In the same call.
Cosby apologized and offered to cover any expenses assoeiated with therapy.
Mrs. Constand reported to investigators that Cosby called her again, the
next day, on January 17, 2005, and that she recorded this call. During the
conversation, Cosby asked if the victim was still pursuing her interests in
broadcasting and expressed his interest in assisting the victim financially with
any educational goals. At one point, Mrs. Constand asked Cosby if he was going
to send her "that pieee of paper with the name of that stuff or not" to which he
responded, "[w]e can talk about what you asked for later." Cosby was evasive on
6
the subject of the identifieation of the pills and quiekly redireeted their
eonversation to travel plans for Mrs. Constand and the vietim. Cosby asked
Mrs. Constand if “they”, meaning her and the vietim, would be willing to travel
"to a eity so that [they eould] have a meeting?"
Aceording to Mrs. Constand, on the next day, January 18, 2005, a
representative of Cosby eontaeted the vietim and attempted to arrange the
meeting, whieh Cosby requested the day before. The representative explained
that Cosby would pay to Пу the vietim and her mother to Florida. Mrs.
Constand and the vietim did not aeeept this offer. Cosby’s representative
provided a statement to investigators on February 4, 2005 in whieh he eonfirmed
that Cosby had direeted him to contaet Mrs. Constand to arrange for her, and
the vietim’s, travel to Florida. He also revealed that he had made similar
arrangements for other women on Cosby’s behalf.
Criminal Investigation and Cosby’s statement to Police
V.
On January 14, 2005, a representative of the Durham Regional Poliee
Serviee forwarded the vietim’s report of this incident to the Philadelphia Poliee
Department speeial Vietim’s Unit. When Philadelphia Poliee learned that
Cosby’s home, the ineident loeation, was aetually in Cheltenham Township in
Montgomery County, they eontaeted the Cheltenham Township Poliee
Department and forwarded to them a eopy of the vietim’s initial report.
Thereafter, the Cheltenham Township Poliee Department and the Montgomery
County Deteetive Bureau eommeneed a joint investigation.
7
On January 26, 2005, Cheltenham Township Police Chief John Norris,
Cheltenham Police Detective Richard Schaffer and Montgomery County
Detective Lieutenant Richard Peffall interviewed Cosby in the presence of
Cosby’s legal counsel.
Cosby described for the investigators his version of what took place at his
home on the evening in question. He stated that he had no intention of having
the victim spend the night at his house. He said that upon the victim’s arrival at
his home, the two had a conversation about issues she was having and her
resulting tension and inability to sleep. He admitted going to his room and
coming down with pills for her to take. He told the investigators the pills were
over-the-counter Benadryl and that he gave her one whole pill and one-half pill.
When investigators asked Cosby about his personal usage of the pills, he told
them he typically took two whole pills and acknowledged they would make him
drowsy and go to sleep right away. He added that he would not take the pills
and go out and perform. Cosby told investigators that these Benadryl pills were
in a pop-out pack and that he carried them with him. Cosby admitted that he
did not tell the victim, on that night or anytime thereafter, the true identity of the
pills.
Cosby said that after the victim took the pills, they began to pet (touching
and kissing) and then he touched her bare breast and her private parts
(genitalia). Cosby said the victim never told him to stop, never pushed him
away, never told him her vision was blurred and never said she felt paralyzed or
affected by the Benadryl. In short, Cosby described the incident as a
8
consensual sexual eneounter. Cosby said that he went to hed after the ineident
and woke sometime later in the morning to find the vietim awake. He said they
talked, he gave her a blueberry muffin and some tea, and then she left.
Cosby then went on to tell the poliee about his history with the vietim. He
aeknowledged that the vietim viewed him as a mentor and that he eneouraged
that type of relationship. However, eontrary to the vietim’s deseription of their
prior relationship, Cosby said it eould be eharaeterized as both soeial and
romantie. He told the investigators that prior to this January 2004 ineident.
there were several instanees in whieh the two “petted and kissed.” He said he
never had intereourse with the vietim beeause he “like[d] the petting the
touehing.” When direetly asked if he ever had sexual intereourse with the
vietim, Cosby gave the unusual answer, “never asleep or awake.”
Investigators also asked Cosby about the eontent of his telephone
eonversations with Mrs. Constand after she learned of this ineident. Cosby said
that he told Mrs. Constand “1 think 1 gave [the vietim] some pills.” He also
eonfirmed that when Mrs. Constand asked him the name of the pills he gave the
vietim, he told her that he would send the name of the drug to her on a pieee of
paper. Cosby said he told Mrs. Constand he touehed the vietim’s breasts and
vagina, but “guarantee[d] her that there was no penile penetration.”
Cosby also told investigators what Mrs. Constand said during that lirst
telephone eonversation about the impaet of the ineident on the Constands.
Aeeording to Cosby, Mrs. Constand said to him that “it is something a mother
never hopes will happen to their daughter and that she did not know how long it
9
would take the victim, and her, to heal.” Cosby told investigators he apologized
twiee and asked Mrs. Constand twiee what she wanted him to do. Aceording to
Cosby, she said there was nothing he eould do and that his apology was enough.
Cosby told investigators that he ealled baek again later and offered to “piek up
the tab” for the vietim to attend graduate school. Cosby also stated that he
attempted to arrange for them to meet him in Florida at a hotel so they could
“iron out whatever these problems happen to be.”
District Attorney Review
VI.
The initial investigation into this incident was reviewed by former District
Attorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. and resulted in the issuance of a February 17,
2005 Press Release, which announced that no criminal charges were
forthcoming. Castor made it clear, however, in the Press Release, that he would
“reconsider th[is] decision should the need arise.”
VII. Civil Action Against Cosby for Battery and Assault
On March 8, 2005, the victim, assisted by private counsel, Bebe H. Kivitz,
Esq., Ann c. Lebowitz, Esq., and Dolores M. Troiani, Esq., initiated a civil claim
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The
civil cause of action asserted against Cosby claimed battery, sexual assault.
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other related claims with regard
to the incident previously investigated by the District Attorney’s Office. The civil
case was settled on July 13, 2006.
10
VIII. Reopening of Criminal Investigation
As the result of an Order issued by the federal judge overseeing the vietim’s
eivil ease against Cosby, portions of depositions he gave in the suit were made
publie for the first time in July of 2015. The release of these depositions
generated a great deal of publieity, as well as a number of public elaims by
women who alleged Cosby had assaulted them under eircumstanees similar to
those reported by the vietim. These events prompted the Montgomely County
Distriet Attorney’s Offiee, now led by Distriet Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman, to
review the statute of limitations regarding potential eriminal offenses eommitted
by Cosby against the vietim. Distriet Attorney Ferman determined that under
Pennsylvania law, proseeution for Aggravated Indeeent Assault must be
eommeneed within twelve years after the offense is eommitted. As sueh, the
statute of limitations had not yet expired, and the investigation was reopened on
July 10, 2015.
As a part of the reopened investigation, a formal written request was made by
Distriet Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman upon Dolores Troiani, Esq. for eopies of her
files related to the eivil aetion, ineluding depositions. In addition, investigators
re-interviewed eertain witnesses who had given statements in 2005. During a
re-interview of Mrs. Constand, she told investigators that in her initial
eonfrontation of Cosby by telephone, she said to him “you are a ver/ siek man.”
Aeeording to Mrs. Constand, Cosby agreed with that aeeusation and repeatedly
11
apologized. He went on to tell her that he “wanted to eall [the vietim] and see
how she was and he wanted to meet and make arrangements in Florida to
discuss an arrangement that was going to make everyhody happy.” Cosby also
asked her whether she had called the poliee.
Investigators also re-interviewed the vietim heeause she had not requested
that the criminal investigation he re-opened. She told investigators she would
cooperate if asked to do so.
IX. Civil Depositions
Upon review of the civil depositions requested of Dolores Troiani, Esquire,
investigators determined that the victim testified under oath in her civil case on
September 27 and 28, 2005. As part of her sworn account of the incident, the
victim testified concerning the details of the sexual assault. She said, in
pertinent part, that upon feeling the effects of the pills, she told Cosby what was
happening to her and he moved her to the couch. After some time, she felt her
body being jostled and felt Cosby’s hand inside her vagina. She also testified
that Cosby placed her hand upon his penis.
Investigators determined that Cosby’s depositions took place on
September 28, 2005, September 29, 2005, March 28, 2006, and March 29, 2006.
In testimony under oath, Cosby testified that he developed a romantic interest in
Constand the vely first time he saw her at the Temple basketball game and that
he found her good looking. He testified that before he acted upon that interest.
he needed to develop a friendship with her.
12
Concerning the incident at issue, he acknowledged inviting the victim to
his Cheltenham home. He said that after some initial conversation, he went
upstairs and got pills, “brought them down,” and “offered them to [the victim].”
Cosby testified that he gave the victim three halved pills, which he described as
“three friends to make [her] relax.” This is contrary to his statement to police, in
which Cosby said he gave her “one whole and then one...half.” Cosby, in his
deposition, said he gave the pills to the victim because he believed, “they might
help take some of the stress away.” He testified, as reported to the police, that
after the administration of the pills, he lifted the victim’s bra so their skin could
touch, got behind the victim “in a spooning position,” and, while in that position,
he went “inside of her pants” and digitally penetrated the victim’s vagina.
During Cosby’s September 29, 2005 deposition he acknowledged that he
had, in the past, obtained seven prescriptions in his own name for Quaaludes
that he never took, nor ever intended to take, himself. During this line of
questioning, the following exchange took place between Dolores Troiani, Esq.
and Cosby:
Troiani: When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you
were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you
wanted to have sex with?
Cosby:
Yes.
(Constand V. Cosby, 9/29/2005 Deposition, p. 71)
Cosby’s attorney then objected to this question and stated, “Restrict it to the
Jane Does.” {Constand V. Cosby, 9/29/2005 Deposition, p. 71-72) Before
being asked another question, Cosby changed his answer to, “I misunderstood.
Woman, meaning [her], and not women.” {Constand V. Cosby, 9/29/2005
13
Deposition, p. 72)
Cosby then speeifieally testified about an occasion in which he met a
woman backstage, gave her Quaaludes and then had sex with her. Further,
when asked why he didn’t ever take Quaaludes himself, he responded that he
gets sleepy. He stated that he knew that Quaaludes are a depressant and
recognized that Quaaludes were, at the time, the drug of choice young people
were using to party. He said, “there were times he wanted to have them just in
case.” {Constand V. Cosby, 9/29/2005 Deposition, p. 70) Cosby admitted that he
knew at the time it was illegal for him to give Quaaludes to another person.
(Constand V. Cosby, 9/29/2005 Deposition, p. 66)

Conclusion
Following their initial meeting at Temple University, Cosby developed a
romantic interest in the victim, an interest she did not share. In his pursuit of
the victim, Cosby promoted his role as mentor and someone who could offer her
life and career guidance. He invited her to a number of social and professional
events at his home and elsewhere. According to the victim, on two of these
occasions, Cosby attempted to touch her inappropriately. Each time, she
immediately shut down his advances, refusing any sexual relationship with
Cosby.
Between mid-January and mid-February 2004, Cosby invited the victim to
his home in Cheltenham, Montgomery County, for the purported purpose of
speaking to her about her future career plans. This was consistent with the role
14
of mentor that he had fostered sinee meeting the vietim. Upon her arrival at his
home, Coshy and the vietim sat and spoke for ahout 10-15 minutes, at whieh
time the vietim went to the hathroom.
It is undisputed that Cosby left the area where they were and returned
shortly with hlue pills. The victim said there were three pills. Coshy told poliee
that he gave her one whole pill and one half-pill. Later, in his deposition, Cosby
testified that he gave her three halves. When the vietim asked if they were
herhal. Coshy said, “yes.” Cosby told poliee she did not ask about the pills, but
admits he never told her what they were. Aceording to the victim, Cosby told
her they would make her feel good and “take the edge off.” Cosby also said they
were “three fnends to help make her relax.” Unfortunately, the victim trusted
Cosby. At his urging, she swallowed the pills with water. Even if the pills
Benadlyl, as Cosby alleged, he acknowledged that the drug makes him drowsy
and puts him to sleep “right away.”
Cosby also successfully urged the victim to “taste the wine,” even though
she told him she had not had much to eat. Investigators know that alcohol is
frequently used as a precursor to sexual assault. Alcohol can be used to
incapacitate victims by itself or in combination with over-the-counter and/or
illicit drugs. Based upon the facts described herein, we have concluded that
when Cosby set out the glass of wine and then, despite the victim’s objections,
urged her to drink, he did so believing her ingestion of the wine would contribute
to her ineapacity. That the victim’s incapacity was his intended result is made
even clearer by his use of both alcohol and drugs.

Cosby knew that his two prior sexual advances were blocked by the much
younger, athletic victim. He knew that further attempts at sexual conduct
would likewise be unsuccessful unless he was able to prevent her from resisting.
He knew the victim could become sedated, and likely rendered incapable of
resistance, by her ingestion of wine and Benadlyl, or wine and another
substance, known only to Cosby, with similar effects.
According to the victim, within twenty to thirty minutes of ingesting the
pills, water, and wine, she experienced blurred vision and difficulty speaking.
which she related to Cosby. She further said her legs felt “rubbery” and “like
jelly,” and everything was “blurry” and “dizzy.” Also, she could not keep her
eyes open and was nauseous. While in this vulnerable state,-Cosby moved her
to a nearby couch.
It is undisputed that Cosby fondled her breasts, put his skin next to hers
and digitally penetrated her vagina. The victim subsequently reported Cosby’s
sexual assault to the police, including his digital penetration. She also testified
about the assault and penetration during her deposition. At no time did the
victim provide her consent. She could not move or speak and was, in her words.
It is clear that what the victim was led to believe was
“frozen” and “paralyzed.”
an herbal remedy had directly contributed to her impaired condition. Because
she was fluctuating in and out of consciousness, the victim was legally incapable
of consenting to Cosby’s actions.
The following language by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court regarding
consent unequivocally supports the above proposition: “[b]ecause the evidence
16
supports the findings that the vietim was intermittently uneonseious throughout
the assault and was at all relevant times in such impaired physieal and mental
condition so as to be unahle to knowingly eonsent, her suhmission to [sexual
fondling and penetration] was involuntary.” Commonwealth V. Emey, 698 A.2d
Likewise, the evidenee here demonstrates that the vietim’s
substantially impaired eondition prevented her ability to eonsent, or even defend
herself from Coshy’s sexual assault.
In further support of our eonelusion that Cosby planned to sexually
assault the victim onee she was sedated and rendered ineapacitated, we
eonsidered, among other things, Cosby’s deposition testimony eoncerning
preseription Quaaludes. Constrained by the topieal parameters of the
deposition, he testified that on one prior oeeasion, he gave a woman Quaaludes
in antieipation of having sex with her. Due to the faet that Cosby obtained
separate preseriptions for Quaaludes that he did not personally ingest, nor
ever intended to personally ingest, we believe it is likely he gave the drugs to
other persons, ineluding other women he planned to have sex with. This
conclusion is supported by the fact that many women have recently
forward to publicly accuse Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them.
Concerning the night of this incident in early 2004, investigators are
mindful of the fact that only Cosby knows what substances he gave the victim.
Only Cosby knows whether the pills were indeed, Benadryl, as he alleged, or a
prescription or illicit drug with even greater potential to render someone
incapaeitated. Only Cosby knew that the drug he gave the victim could impair

her ability to perceive, diminish her ability to rememher, or render her useless as
a witness against him.
One of the most signifieant faetors investigators have eonsidered is
Coshy’s evasive and eonflicting identineations of the drug he gave the vietim.
Aecording to the vietim, she asked what the drug was and he told her it was
herhal. Coshy denies this exchange ever took place. It is undisputed that
Coshy told the victim’s mother that he gave her some sort of prescription hut that
he could not recall what it was. He told her that he could not read the label on
the hottle because of his poor eyesight. Coshy told Mrs. Constand he would
write the name of the drug on a piece of paper and mail it to her, but he never

over-the-counter medicine not dispensed in a prescription bottle as Cosby told
Mrs. Constand. Cosby’s deliberate efforts to conceal the nature of the pills he
supplied to his unsuspecting victim are inconsistent with innocent behavior and
demonstrate his consciousness of guilt.
Further indicative of Cosby’s consciousness of guilt is the fact that, when
confronted by Mrs. Constand over the telephone, he apologized to both her and
the victim, while offering significant financial assistance. Cosby not only offered
to pay for the victim’s therapy, but also her graduate school tuition and expenses
for travel to Florida. Investigators recognize that individuals who are falsely
accused of sexual assault generally do not unilaterally offer generous financial
assistance, and apologies, to their accuser and their accuser’s family. To the
contrary, such conduct is consistent with offenders who are seeking to make
18
amends for wrongful behavior and prevent involvement by law enforeement.
Finally, investigators identified two statements which they believe provide
unusually compelling insight regarding Cosby’s sexual relationships with
women, including his assaultive behavior towards the victim. While speaking
with Mrs. Constand, Cosby made sure that she understood there was no “penile
penetration” involved. Presumably, Cosby considers lack of intercourse as a
means to diminish his culpability and lessen the gravity of his sexual offenses.
Secondly, during his statement to police, Cosby was asked whether he ever had
sexual intercourse with Constand. He responded “never asleep or awake,”
inferring that either could be possible as a reasonable answer.
upon examination of all the evidence, we believe there is probable cause
that on the night of this incident in mid-janualy to mid-February of 2004, Cosby
sought to incapacitate the victim by providing her with his “three friends” and
some wine. He wanted to ensure that she would not rebuff his sexual advances
as before, and he succeeded in doing so. As the victim lie on his couch, sedated
and under the influence of the unknown substance he supplied and identified as
an herbal, Cosby fondled her and digitally penetrated her vagina. Contraly to
his assertion that she consented to this conduct, she could not do so. She was
rendered unable to speak or even move, and left capable only to perceive aspects
of this Aggravated Indecent Assault.
Based upon the foregoing, we respectfully request a warrant of arrest be
