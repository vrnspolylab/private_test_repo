AFFIDAVIT of PROBABLE CAUSE
On 01/04/14, Timothy DAVisoN was traveiling home to Maine after visiting famiiy in Fiorida, Around 0200 hours, an ongoing crime
was reported via a 911 cali by DAVISON beginning in Washington County, Maryland, He was traveliing nollh on interstate 81 when he
was approached by what he calied a dark coiored Ford Ranger pickup truck. The suspect vehicie came ciose to him and aiongside of
him, firing gunshots at his vehicie. The incident continued a number of miles and continued into Pennsyivania, remaining on Interstate
81. DAVisoN related that around Exit 3, the suspect vehicie struck his vehicie, forcing him into the median and eventuaily northbound
in the southbound ianes. DAVisoN brought his vehicie to a stop in the median. Whiie speaking with the Pennsyivania state Police
(PSP) dispatcher, minutes after the coilision, DAVisoN exciaimed that the actor, who had continued north, was back at the scene (and
his iocation). DAVisoN’s iocation at that point was Interstate 81 in the area of Exit 3 (Antrim Township, Frankiin County, PA). Audibie
on the 911 recording is an engine revving, shots being fired and a vehicle’s wheels squealing and acceierating away from the scene.
The investigation has shown that the actor shot DAVisoN muitipie times at that point, before fieeing the scene southbound on
interstate 81. DAVISON was attended to by  rst responders and medicai personnei. He was struck in the left hand, right ieg and
head. The victim died a short time later in York Hospital as a result of the injuries sustained in the shooting,
DAVISON was found in the driver's seat of his siiver Mitsubishi Montero, Bullet hoies were observed in the driver's side door. Giass
was shattered on the driver side and passenger side, front windows. Aiso found were marks believed to be from the suspect’s vehicle
acceierating from and fieeing the scene. They were observed on the ground extending from the victim’s vehicle location heading
southbound onto the lanes of travel. Near those acceleration/tire marks was found a single, spent brass casing. The casing is from a
.44 caliber round. Fired bullets and fragments were found in the vehicle. Lab analysis would later show the recovered fired
bullets/fragments from the vehicle were also from ,44 caliber rounds.
The continuing investigation included a search of the area for different video surveiliance that couid aid this Investigation. A

AFFIDAVIT of PROBABLE CAUSE
On 01/08/14, a second search of the greater scene of this crime was conducted on Interstate 81, The snow had melted, allowing for
the possibility of finding additional evidence. The search found an emblem (or badging) from a Ford Ranger XLT. It is an emblem,
affixed by the factory, on the front fenders of Ford Ranger XLTS, identifying it as a Ford Ranger XLT. It was found within feet of where
the victim’s Montero left the roadway and entered the grass median. This is believed to be the location where the impact between the
two vehicles occurred, The badge piece was broken, not whole. Verification through Ford’s database identified that particular badging
to be present on Ford Ranger XLT models from 1995 - 2006.
Analysis of the paint transferred from the suspect vehicle to the victim’s vehicle was completed by the Federal Bureau of investigation
(FBI) laboratory. It was determined to be “Dark Lapis Metallic,’’ In color. It is a specific Ford paint coiorthat is dark blue. The paint
sample consisted of 5 layers. All were deemed to be original manufacture layers, except for the top clear coat layer. This suggests the
suspect vehicle would have been repaired, In the area of the colllslon (left front), prior to this incident. The dark lapis paint limited Ford
Ranger models to those manufactured in between 1993 -1997 (and some 1998s).
The initial investigation of the victim's vehicle included gathering information from the Garmin GPS unit in his Montero. The device was
able to be downloaded which Included thousands of waypoints tracking his route of travel from Florida. The previous hours of travel
were entirely on Interstate 81, with the exception of stop(s) for fuel. More importantly, traveling speeds could be gleaned from the data
available on the device. By putting those waypoint locations and speeds on a map, one could gain an overview of his changes in
speed. On Interstate 81, DAVISON was coming north around 80 miles per hour, fairiy constantly. Once he reached the area of exit 16
in Martinsburg, wv, his speed acceierated. From exit 16 north, into Maryland and Pennsylvania, the Montero’s speed Increased to 90
and over 100 mph, at times. That is not seen anywhere south of Martinsburg, in West Virginia or Virginia.
In assisting this investigation, the FBI was able to complete “tower dumps’’ for multiple cellular communication towers near the scene of
this crime. This process was initiated to gather both potential suspects and witnesses to the homicide. The process entails gathering
all data and records (available from any given tower), dunng a specified time period. When cellular towers are utilized by consumers
(using ali cellular devices), they subsequently create records for the contacts made with the devices. The tower dump process
provides a list of phone numbers that utilized that tower during the specified period. It includes detaiis of the cellular contact between
each device and the cellular tower. In March 2014 and again in October 2014, we received the results of the tower dumps. The
towers chosen for the dumps spanned from the crime scene (in Pennsylvania), south into West Virginia. Continued--

Ongoing examination of the spent .44 caliber casing yielded results beiieved to be similar with a lever action pistoi made by Rossi,
known as a “Ranch Hand”. Experts in the PSP Balilstics Section determined that the class characteristics of the impression on the
primer contained markings oniy seldom seen. A potentially similar casing and primer impression was located on a database in Flonda.
That similar primer impression came from a known Rossi Ranch hand pistoi. That provided the possibiiity that a Rossi Ranch Hand or
similar firearm was used during the commission of this homicide.
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) examination was also done on the single .44 spent casing. The results showed a partial or incompiete
profile was obtained. it was available for comparison to a potentiai suspect, if availabie in the future,
On 04/20/15 at 1515 hours, investigators at PSP Chambersburg were contacted by Jamie BREESE regarding the DAVisoN homicide.
He described how a man known to him and his wife Courtney BREESE, named John STRAWSER, had been arrested in West Virginia.
STRAWSER iived in Terra Aita, wv. He drove a dark colored Ford Ranger that previously had damage to its left front. According to
BREESE, STRAWSER gets in rages, BREESE believed that STRAWSER was hunting him and his wife the night DAVisoN was
killed. He guessed that STRAWSER mistook DAVISON’S siiver SUV for theirs (a silver Honda Piiot). BREESE recailed the ерес|яс
night and what they were doing. The next morning, he saw the news that reported DAVISON had been kiiled. He thought
STRAWSER might have done it, STRAWSER used to be a friend of his wife. He used to stalk her. People had told him that
STRAWSER said he would kili Jamie to get to Courtney.
i found Internet articles con rming what BREESE had related. John Wayne STRAWSER, Jr. was charged in a homicide Investigation
in the Kingwood, w/ area, around 04/16/15. The victim in that case was Amy Lou BUCKINGHAM.
After confirming the information, more extensive interviews of the BREESES were conducted, Courtney BREESE was interviewed
about her knowledge of John STRAWSER. She described him as having been a friend of the family for years. She reiuctantiy
admitted to having a relationship with STRAWSER dunng her marriage. STRAWSER displayed unpredictable behavior. He had been
possessive and acted vioiently. Even though he lived about 2.5 hours away in West Virginia, he would just show up at places nearby.
Courtney explained incidents she referred to as serial staiking through anonymous text messages. She believed STRAWSER was
sending her the texts. She was able to provide old phone numbers for STRAWSERS (304-435'9467 / 304-435-5608). Continued--

She recounted being with her husband at Cloud 9 In West Virginia, in late 2013. (Cloud 9 Is believed to be 12261 Winohester Avenue
Bunker Hill, WV) It Is a dance club located off of the Interstate 81, south of Martinsburg, While at Cloud 9, STRAWSER began calling
and texting them wanting to know their location. They told him Cloud 9, and a short time later they saw him come out of the bathroom
there. They believed he had been looking for them and showed up there,
They had a falling out in January 2015 and they decided to avoid him. They had not spoken regularly since. Courtney related the last
contact she had with him was months ago.
On the night DAVISON was kllled, they were again at Cloud 9. As they departed STRAWSER began calling and texting. STRAWSER
spoke to Jamie BREESE and started threatening them,
The path the BREESES took was Interstate 81 north, Into Pennsylvania. It Is the same path of travel taken by Timothy DAVISON in
this case. Courtney BREESE related that at the time STRAWSER drove a dark blue Ford Ranger which he has since changed the
color of his truck. She thinks it could now be black and green.
Jamie BREESE related that STRAWSER drove a Ranger that he painted a different color after this homicide. It had damage to the
front fender. Jamie BREESE specifically recalled that on the night of 01/03 - 01/04/14, when he and his wife were at Cloud 9,
STRAWSER started trying to contact them, He Inquired where they were. He ended up talking to STRAWSER on the phone.
STRAWSER was calling Courtney names and threatening them. He wanted to know where they were but they refused to tell him.
BREESE was driving north on the Interstate at that time. The BREESES would have been in the area of spring Mills / Marlowe exits
(In WV), He thought it was around 0130 hours (approximately) on 01/04/14. He got the Indication that STRAWSER was looking for
them and was nearby. The next morning, he saw the news that DAVISON had been killed. He suggested to Courtney that
STRAWSER could have done this. She dismissed the idea. Jamie related that STRAWSER worked in automotive type jobs and could
have painted the truck himself when he changed the color.
Checks through the Pennsylvania Cnminal Intelligence Center (PACIC) yielded the following results:
-STRAWSER has listed a 1997 Ford Ranger (VIN: 1FTCR15X8VTA53548) that is dark lapis metallic ‘'KN”, The record shows the
truck is a club cab.
-Vanous phone numbers were found for STRAWSER. All possible numbers (from PACIC and BREESE) were run through the tower
dump data:
304-435-9467 an old cell number for STRAWSER, provided by BREESE
717-414-4230 BREESE’ old cell number

On 04/28/16 the above numbers were found on our tower dump under Атбст Batoh results. BREESE’ number was found on the first
tower dump. The STRAWSER number was found on the second set of tower dump data. Further clarification showed that
STRAWSER’S phone contact was a 15 minute phone call with another number (304-290-0810). That called utlllzed multiple towers
from wv travelling north into Maryland. The called ended in Hagerstown, MD, at 0156 hours. (The victim had cailed 911 from
Hagerstown, MD at 0159 hours.) The 304-290-0810 phone number was believed to beiong to a Floraenceanne MILLER. The
Investigation found that MILLLER was one of severa! women involved in a relationship with STRAWSER.
On 05/07/15, PSP investigators met with the West Virginia state Police (WVSP) in Kingwood, wv. They explained the facts and
circumstances surrounding the BUOKiNGHAM homicide and the arrest of STRAWSER. WVSP personnel related that when they had
served a search warrant at STRAWSER’S home (109 Cale Avenue Terra Alta, WV), they observed the previously mentioned Ford
Ranger. It шв painted black and green. A closer look showed what appeared to be the onginal dark blue paint, In places, on the
truck.
PSP investigators traveled to the location and observed the Ranger parked beside the tralier at 109 Cale Avenue, It was black and
green as previously described. It appeared to have different parts on It including the front end and griil that are newer than the 1993-
1998 timeframe.
During the West Virginia Investigation an interested neighbor and friend of STRAWSER (Gordon ‘'Ernie” KisNER) offered his
assistance. KisNER related having spent time with STRAWSER and knowing that he frequented a nearby field and swamp along the
adjacent raiiroad tracks. KISNER showed Troopers to the iocation he spoke of. There, WVSP Troopers found a wooden box on the
ground that contained a .44 caiiber Rossi Ranch Hand pistol. Their search of the home also yielded .44 cailber rounds (live rounds
and spent casing(s)).
On 05/11/15, PSP investigators continued their inquiry into John Wayne STRAWSER, JR. Search warrants were obtained and
executed for: the black and green Ford Ranger (prevlously mentioned) as well as the property and residence at 109 Cale Avenue.
The extended cab Ford Ranger was seized from the driveway of the residence. It was towed back to Franklin County, PA, for further
examination.
PSP Investigators traced the origin and owners of the Rossi Ranch Hand pistol that WVSP - Kingwood had in their possession. It was
delivered from the manufacturer to a dealer in 2012. All owners, since then, were identined inciuding the individuai who ultimately sold
the firearm to STRAWSER. One of the prior owners reiated still having a box of .44 caliber ammunition. The box contained unfired
rounds as well as Яred casings, with primers stili Intact. The fired casings were sent to the PSP Lab for analysis. Analysis comparing
the newly discovered Яred casings and the singie  red .44 caiiber shell casing from the DAVISON scene showed that the shells were
discharged within the same Ягеагт.

AFFIDAVIT of PROBABLE CAUSE
On 05/12/15, PSP investigators interviewed John Wayne STRAWSER JR. at Tygart Valiey Regional Jaii in Beimgton, West Virginia.
STRAWSER denied being in the area on the day of the crime. He reiated he was working (hauiing coai as a truck driver) hours West
of Frankiin County, PA. He conяrmed that he knew the BREESE famiiy and various routes to their home. STRAWSER reiated that he
was famiiiar with the area. Each time he had gone to see the BREESES, no one eise was ever with him. He was aione and did not
generaliy iet others drive or borrow his truck. We explained that phone records and the BREESES themseives showed that he was, in
fact, in Frankiin County, PA. We asked if something happened on interstate 81 with him that led to the death of Timothy DAVISON.
STRAWSER repiied, “i don't remember.'’
This investigation showed that John Wayne STRAWSER, Jr. is caiied “Boo” by his friends and famiiy. On 05/13/15, a continued review
of STRAWSER’s Facebook account (under “Boo STRAWSER”) showed “Boo STRAWSER" providing a phone contact number to
others as 304-435-9467. it showed this number was being used by STRAWSER in iate 2013. Further, in 2014, Boo STRAWSER’S
Facebook records showed attempts to seii a Rossi Ranch Hand lever action pistol. The offer included a photograph of the Ягеагт.
Also visible in the account’s photographs is a Ford Ranger that is dark biue in coior. The biue truck shows the same green custom
paint as the STRAWSER Ford Ranger that is in PSP custody. That Ford Ranger, previously identined, is now black in color.
On 05/12/15, pursuant to a search warrant executed in Randolph County, wv, DNA swabs were coliected from the ieft and right
cheeks of John Wayne STRAWSER, Jr. The sampies were deiivered to the Bode Laboratory, who conducted the most recent
examination on the DNA availabie in this case.
On 05/22/15, Bode reported their resuits. The partiai ргоя|е obtained from the .44 caliber casing matched the corresponding portions
of John Wayne STRAWSER Jr.’s complete DNA ргоя|е,
On 05/26/15, a search warrant was conducted on STRAWSER'S Ford Ranger in an attempt to gather additionai evidence. Noted on
the front of the truck, above the windshieid is a set of amber visor iights. in re-accessing and reviewing the originai footage of the
crime taking place (from the PA Department of Transportation camera),the grainy video (and stiiis) shows an additional iine of light
above the glow of the headiights, which is consistent with the visor lighting seen on STRAWSER’S vehicle.
On 05/26/15, a gunshot residue test (GSR) was performed on the interior of the STRAWSER’S Ford Ranger. On 07/01/15, iab
analysis showed that particies charactenstic of GSR were found on the driver’s side headrest, seat and ceiling. Continued"

AFFIDAVIT of PROBABLE CAUSE
In June 2015, celluiar phone records for 304-435-9467 were obtained and anaiyzed. The records Showed the celiular towers used by
the phone which iilustrated that the phone travelled from the area of Terra Alta, wv, to Hagerstown, MD between 01/03/14 and
01/04/14. The phone’s last usage ended in Hagerstown, MD on 01/04/14 at 0156 hours. {Again, DAVISON called 911 from
Hagerstown, MD at 0159 hours.). Prior to the crime, the records also showed a route of travel that Included going south of
Martinsburg, wv, on Interstate 81, before returning north. That not only matches DAVISON'S route and time of travel but also reяects
the BREESES' reported location, The phone records also show contact and many attempted contacts from STRAWSER to the
BREESE phones.
On 06/19/15, investigators made contact with Jill GARBART of Hillside Trucking. STRAWSER was employed by Hillside trucking,
hauling coal, both before and after this crime took place, Hiilside trucking was able to provide a work schedule and history for
STRAWER’S employment. STRAWSER was not working on 01/04/14 as he indicated when Interviewed.
On 07/24/15, a PSP Ballistic Expert completed an examination of evidence available in this oase, as well as Its comparison to the
Rossi Ranch Hand. Forensio examination of the discharged bullets and builet fragments recovered from the victim’s person and
vehicle showed they had been discharged from the Rossi iever-actlon pistol, model: Ranch Hand, caliber: .44 Magnum, senal number:
M174766 (currently In the custody of the West Virginia state Police). Further examination of the discharged cartridge case found at the
scene of the homicide showed that it had been discharged within that same Ягеагт (as previously noted).
Based upon the information detaiied in the above affidavit, I respectfuliy request that the defendant be brought forth to answer to the
charge against him.
I, TPR. JASON CAGHARA, BEING DULY SWORN ACCORDING TO THE LAW, DEPOSE AND SAY THAT THE
