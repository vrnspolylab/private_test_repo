RUTLAND COUNTY s.s.
NOW COMES, Detective 1®* class, Corporal Raymolld J. LaMoria Jr. affiant, being duly
swom and on oath deposes and says he has probahle cause to believe that Sandra Eastman
DOB:03/14/1983 has conimitted the offense of; Cruelty to ehildren under 10 by one over 16 in
violation of Titlel3 Vermont statuLes Annotated, Section 1304.
On February 14, 2013 at approximately 1030 hours Investigator icristy Post of the Vermont
Department for Children and Families Service (DCF), Rutland, Vermont office contacted this
writer.
Inv. Post advised that Orl Febmaiy 14,2013 at around 0503 hours The Rutland Regiolral
Medical Center Emergency room physician, Allison Davis MD contacted DCF with a report of
suspected physical abuse of an 11 month old child. Juvenile A DOB: 02/18/2012.
It was reported that on this date at 0430 Sandra Eastman DOB: 03/14/1983 brought her daughter
Juvenile A into the Emergency Room at RRMC. The report states that Sandra told the hospital
that the child spent Tuesday February 12, 2013 with Sandra’s sister and since then the child has
not wanted to crawl. Dr. Davis did an x-ray and it was foxmd that there was a right tibia fracture.
The report stated that Sandra has no explanation for the injury or why it took so long fo get
medical treatment.
Inv. Post went to RRMC where she leamed that an examination of Juvenile A revealed a right
tibia fracture and scratches on her right lower leg. That Sandra told the doctor that she did not
have a ride to the hospital any sooner than this morning and that is why she had not brought the
child before now. Juvenile A was admitted and transferred to the Women and Children’s unit.
Inv. Post spoke with Dr. Indra Lovko, the pediatrician on the Women and Children’s unit
attending to Juvenile A. Dr. Lovko stated that Juvenile A had a babygrarn (a full body x-ray for
children) and there is a right tibia fracture and the radiologist also found a left tibia spiral fracturp
wluch was bowing indicatmg a possible injury. The Ifactures did not seem to be the same age.
Dr. Lovko stated that Sandra was very vague about what may have happened to Juvenile A but
stated she did not know what happened. These x-ray were sent to Dr. Patno, pediatric specialist
and abuse and neglect consultant, Fletcher Allen Ilospital.
Dr. Lovko stated that “this injury could npt have happened by accident, the child could not have
injured herself and that something bad happened fo Juvenile A.”
Inv. Post spoke with Deirdre, RN on Women and Children’s unit at RRMC. Deirdre stated that
Sandra has been very vague with her explanation of what happened to Juvenile A but that she
knew Juvenile A was in pain and gave her Tylenol on February 13, 2012.

AFFIDAVIT,
STATE OF VERMONT
RUTLAND COUNTY s.s.
Inv. Post interviewed Sandra at RRMC. Sandra stated that she did not know what happened to
Juvenile A and that she started notieing Juvenile A was in pain on Fehruary 13,2012 when
Juvenile A stopped erawling and seemed to he in pain. Sandra stated she did not seek medieal
treatment sooner heeause she did not have a ride. When asked by investigator Post why she did
not eall an amhulanee, Sandra stated that she thought the pain was eoming from Juvenile A’s
cluh foot. Sandra stated that no one has heen alone with Juvenile A exeept for herself.
Inv. Post spoke with Dr. Patno, pediatrie specialist and abuse and neglect consultant, who agreed
to consult on the case and stated that h:om the information and reviewing Juvenile A’s X-rays,
she believes that “for the child’s safety, the child should be in custody with DCF until she can
have a ‘child safe’ appointment for a full exam and skeletal scan’' with Dr. Patno.
Inv. Post spoke with Orthopedic Doctor Eric Marsh; he stated that the left h-acture is not likely
an acute fracture. The right tibia fracture is an acute fracture. Dr. Marsh stated that Sandra told
him that she has no idea how the fracture happened.
At approximately 1200 hours this writer and Inv. Post traveled to the Rutland Regional Medical
Center where an interview of Sandra Eastman was conducted by this writer. Eastman originally
d ied knowing anything about how Juvenile A was mjured. However айег questioning
Eastman, she became emotional and advised that on Tuesday February 12,2013 at around 0200
hours she had gotten up to change her daughter’s Juvenile A’s diaper. When she went to put
Juvenile A back in the pack and play where she slept, Juvenile A wiggled out of her arms and
she dropped Juvenile A.
Juvenile A struck her legs on the rail of the pack and play and then bounced off the rail and
landed on fhë fidor of the pack and play. Sandra advised that Juvenile A screamed and cried.
That she was ahle to pick her up and comfort her then put her back to sleep. Sandra advised that
over the next two days Juvenile A did not seem to he herself, not crawling. She finally decided to
bring her to the emergency room Thursday moming February 14,2013.
After speaking with Sandra this writer and Inv. Post spoke with Dr. Patno about what we had
leamed. In speaking with Dr. Patno she advised that the injuries sustained to Juvenile A were not
consistent with the information Sandra provided.
This writer and Inv. Post again met with Sandra and advised her of our concems. Sandra stated
that the pack and play incident did occurred the way she told US but that it occurred 3 or 4 weeks
ago. That most recently, Monday night February 11,2013 durmg the aRernoon hours she was at
home 123 College Street Poultney Vermont getting ready to leave the house with Juvenile A to
go shopping. They live in an upstairs apartment. She had left the door openjnd-  ext thing

she knew Juvenile A еате erawling by her and was just about to fall down the stairs. It scared
Sandra and she grabhed Juvenile A by the right leg around the anide area and pulled her back
hard eausing Juvenile A to strike the door easing with her legs. Sandra advised that she pulled
Juvenile A so hard that she knew she had hurt Juvenile A. Juvenile A sereamed and started
erying. Sandra advised she was seared and deeided not to bring Juvenile A for treatment hoping
that she didn’t hurt her badly. However over the next three days Juvenile A did not seem to get
any better she was unable to crawl and acted as though she was in pain. Sandra advised that she
gave Juvenile A Tylenol for her pain but on Thursday moming decided she needed to bring
Juvenile A to the Medieal Center for examination.
Sandra advised that she has never intentionally hurt her daughter or any of her children.
With this new information this ’writer and Inv. Post again consulted with Dr. Patno. Dr. Patno
advised that this again was not eonsistent with the mechanism of inj’ury. Dr. Patno stated that
she consulted with Dr. Higgins, an expert pediatric specialist, and they agreed that the right tibia
fracture is seven to ten days old. Since Monday, February 11, 2013 is not ’within that time frame
it is not likely that that is when the injury occurred.
On February 21,2013 this ’writer received the ’written report in regards to fiirther examination of
Juvenile A from Dr. Karyn Patno MD. Fletcher Allen Health Care, University Pediatrics.
Dr. Patno’s assessment is:
Juvenile A is a 1-year old female who presents with a comminuted ffacture of the right distal
tibia. At the time of presentation, this ffacture was 7 to 10 days old. This fracture would require a
significant amount of force to result in a comminuted ffacture as seen in Juvenile A. This is not a
simple toddler ffacture, which can occur ffom relatively minimal force. This ffacture would have
resulted in significant discomfort and is unlikely to have gone unnotieed by a supervising adult.
Juvenile A’s mother has been unable to give an adequate history as to the mechanism of the
injury causing this ffacture.
The abnormality seen in the lefi: tibia is more subtle may represent a buckle type fracture. This
type of ffacture occurs when force is applied along the longitudinal axis of the bone. The typical
force causing this type of ffacture is different ffom the type of force causing a comminuted
fracture as seen in the right tibia. This suggests two separate incidents. The lack of an
explanation for these fractures in a child this age is very conceming for non- accidental trauma.
Based on the information provided in this affidavit, the expert medieal assessment of Juvenile A
by Dr. Patno and others stating that the injuries were 7 to 10 days old. The inconsistent

information on how Juvenile A sustained her injuries provided by Sandra Eastman who is over
the age of 16 having sole eustody and eharge of eare of Juvenile A and Juvenile A being a child
under the age of 10 years. The fact that Sandra Eastman admitted to concealing the incident of
pulling Juvenile A by her leg knowing that she caused pain and injury to Juvenile A and did not
seek immediate medical ahention causing the child unnecessary sulfering. This writer has
probable cause to believe that Sandra Eastman DOB: 04/19/1983 has committed the offense of
Cruelty to children under the age of 10 by one over 16. Title 13 VSA 1304.
